# Phrase Hunters


This is a word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter", built using Python and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) approaches to select a phrase at random, hidden from the player. 

A player tries to guess the phrase by inputting individual characters. There is a limit on the maximum attempts they are allowed to have.
